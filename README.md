# cs120-lab6-ticketMaster
My first cs project: 
 In this lab, we are going to implement a tickiting system. That, we are going to sell tickets.
Part I:

    one ticket for an adult is $7.5.

    one ticket for a student (10 - 18 years old) is $5.

    one ticket for a child (> 5 years) is $2.

    Your system will do the following:
        Tickets for adult or student?

        How many tickets?

        Print out the receipt.

Part II:

    Modify Part I with the following:
        give 20% discount if an adult is a veteran.

        give 50% discount if a student has been in community service.

Part III:

    Modify Part II with the following:
        give 20% discount if an adult is either a veteran or currenlty in the military service.

        give 25% discount if a child has at least a sibling.
